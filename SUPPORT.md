## Report a Bug or submit a Feature Request

Have you found a bug in the Power Automate AVD Starter Kit Starter Kit or do you want to suggest a new feature? Either way, please let us now by filing an issue while observing the following guidelines

### Look for an existing issue

Before submitting your issue please search the [issues](https://github.com/Azure/powerautomate-avd-starter-kit/issues) to ensure your issue has not already been reported.

If your bug or feature request has already been reported, join the conversation by commenting and adding your reaction. Please use reactions to vote and not "+1" comments.

- üëç - upvote
- üëé - downvote

### Submitting your Issue

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

## Asking and Answering Questions

Join the [discussions](https://github.com/microsoft/powerautomate-avd-starter-kit/discussions) and ask your question or contribute by answering questions from others. This is a great way to contribute by helping the Power Automate AVD Starter Kit community.

If you have general questions about Power Platform Governance, unrelated to the CoE Starter Kit, please raise them in the [Power Automate Community forum](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Power-Automate/ct-p/MPACommunity)
